# PLCnext Examples
These examples have been developed to provide some insight or a starting point for common functions with the PLCnext that are asked. See a brief overview and additional links and resources at the bottom. These links can provide more information and guidance with the PLCnext and are official resources for information.

These examples include a PLCnext Engineer project `*.pcwex` or `*.pcweax`. These can be downloaded and opened with the free [PLCnext Engineer](https://www.phoenixcontact.net/product/1046008) software. The most recent LTS version is recommended unless specified otherwise.
