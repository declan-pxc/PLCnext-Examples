# Alarming Demo
This project demonstrates the different ways of alarming on PLCnext.

- the alarms in NewProgram are not connected to the AlarmServer even when the same AlarmID is used. These alarms conform to the OPC UA alarming convention. More information can be found [here](https://www.plcnext.help/te/Functions_and_applications/Alarm_Function_Blocks_IEC61131.htm)
- the other method of alarming that allows interaction easier with the HMI is the AlarmServer. More information can be found [here](https://engineer.plcnext.help/latest/HMI_Alarming.htm).

  This is not an exhaustive list of functionality but is designed to show a way of getting started with alarming on the PLCnext.
